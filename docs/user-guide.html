    <h1>MajorManager Documentation</h1>
    <h2>User Guide</h2>
    <p>MajorManager is designed to easily manage your students, including emails and majors for quick reference. This guide will inform you of various functions in the program so that you can use them effectively.</p>

    <h3>Interface</h3>
    <h4>Left Side</h4>
    <p>Clicking on the blank user icon allows you to upload a new profile picture.</p>
    
    <h4>Table</h4>
    <p>You can click on the header of any column to sort in ascending or descending order. The default is ascending by ID.</p>
    
    <h4>Right Side</h4>
    <p>The info boxes are, (from top to bottom), First Name, Last Name, Department, Major, Email, and optionally, a URL to a profile image. Major is a drop-down.<br>
    Filling them out will allow you to click <b>Add</b> and insert this person into the table.<br>
    You can quickly clear these fields with the <b>Clear</b> button.</p>
    <p>If you click on a user in the table, their information will automatically populate in the fields. If you change this information and click <b>Edit</b>, it will update the table.</p>
    <p>If you click <b>Delete</b>, they will be removed from the table. YOU CANNOT UNDO THIS, SO BE CAREFUL!</p>
